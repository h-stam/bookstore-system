# Bookstore System

Bookstore System was created for Agile Software Development course.
This project was developed by: H. Arshad, A. Aldoreh, O Alchalabi, C. Horne, C. Bialkowski, M. Hua, T. Ivue, and H. Stam (myself).

The focus of this project was to create a bookstore system, while applying agile methodologies such as scrum and extreme programming (XP) techniques.  The main XP techniques taht our group implemented was test driven development (using black-box testing / white-box testing), pair programming, user stories, and frequent standup meetings.

The bookstore system allowed users to register, login, search (through an advanced filtering system), and purchase books stored in a database.

The bookstore system was created using Visual Studio and coded in C#.  The project management was recorded on Clubhouse.
